https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/description/

Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 <= k <= BST's total elements.

Follow up:
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently?
How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
